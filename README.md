## Overview

Spline Path Control is a simple tool designed to make it easy to create motion controls. It allows you to create and animate shapes that follow splines, and then export the result as a `.webm` video file.

This project was created to simplify the process of generating control videos for tools like VACE. Use it to control the motion of anything (camera movement, objects, humans etc) all without extra prompting.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Spline Editing:** Create multiple, independent spline paths
* **Easy To Use Controls:** Quickly edit splines and points
* **Full Control of Splines and Shapes:**
    * **Start Frame:** Set a delay before a spline's animation begins.
    * **Duration:** Control the speed of the shape along its path.
    * **Easing:** Apply `Linear`, `Ease-in`, `Ease-out`, and `Ease-in-out` functions for smooth acceleration and deceleration.
    * **Tension:** Adjust the "curviness" of the spline path.
    * **Shape Customization:** Change the shape (circle, square, triangle), size, fill color, and border.
* **Reference Images:** Drag and drop or upload a background image to trace paths over an existing image.
* **WebM Export:** Export your animation with a white background, perfect for use as a control video in VACE.

## üîÑ Recent Updates

* **6/17/25:**
    * Fixed splines looping in exported video. Now the animation will only play once in the exported video.
    * Made the export UI prettier üòé

* **6/17/25:**
    * Added **Start Frame** control to delay the beginning of a spline's animation.
